This repository contains the hands-on Python programming assignments from my collegeâ€™s 36-hour Final School Program. It covers the fundamentals of Python in a structured, beginner-friendly format across 30 days of progressive learning.
The goal of this challenge is to help absolute beginners understand Python syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and more â€” laying the foundation for real-world problem solving.
ðŸ”° Ideal for those starting their Python journey through self-paced practice.
